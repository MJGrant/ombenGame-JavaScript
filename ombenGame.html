//Omben, or "Drink", is a 2-player card guessing game
/*
The Indonesian version of Go Fish is known as Omben in Javanese or Minuman in Indonesian, both names meaning "drink". It is said to be best for two players, each of whom begins with a hand of 4 or 5 cards (according to agreement) drawn from a 52 card pack. The players take turns to ask their opponent for a rank, such as 8 or king, and the opponent must give the asker all cards of that rank that he or she holds. If the opponent has no such card the asker must "drink" by drawing cards from the pile of undealt cards: the asker continues to draw until he or she finds a card of the rank that was asked for. Whenever a player has four of a kind in hand, it must be discarded face up. The winner is the first player to get rid of all their cards - it does not matter how many or few sets they have made. If the stock runs out, the player with fewer cards is the winner. Note that in this game the players ask alternately, irrespective of whether the card asked for is found in the other player's hand or the draw pile.
